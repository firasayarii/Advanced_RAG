Check my previous post on controllable text generation.\\n[My personal spicy take] In my opinion, some prompt engineering papers are not worthy 8 pages long, since those tricks can be explained in one or a few sentences and the rest is all about benchmarking. An easy-to-use and shared benchmark infrastructure should be more beneficial to the community. Iterative prompting or external tool use would not be trivial to set up. Also non-trivial to align the whole research community to adopt it.\\nBasic Prompting#\\nZero-shot and few-shot learning are two most basic approaches for prompting the model, pioneered by many LLM papers and commonly used for benchmarking LLM performance.\\nZero-Shot#\\nZero-shot learning is to simply feed the task text to the model and ask for results.\\n(All the sentiment analysis examples are from SST-2)\\nText: i'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film.\\nSentiment:\\nFew-shot#\\nFew-shot learning presents a set of high-quality demonstrations, each consisting of both input and desired output, on the target task. As the model first sees good examples, it can better understand human intention and criteria for what kinds of answers are wanted. Therefore, few-shot learning often leads to better performance than zero-shot. However, it comes at the cost of more token consumption and may hit the context length limit when input and output text are long.\\nText: (lawrence bounces) all over the stage, dancing, running, sweating, mopping his face and generally displaying the wacky talent that brought him fame in the first place.\\nSentiment: positive\"),\n",

It incorporates multiple demonstration examples across different tasks in the prompt, each demonstration consisting of instruction, task input and output.

For tasks that are easy to validate such as a programming question with unit tests, we can simply run through the interpreter and verify the correctness with unit tests.\\nChain-of-Thought (CoT)#\\nChain-of-thought (CoT) prompting (Wei et al. 2022) generates a sequence of short sentences to describe reasoning logics step by step, known as reasoning chains or rationales, to eventually lead to the final answer. The benefit of CoT is more pronounced for complicated reasoning tasks, while using large models (e.g. with more than 50B parameters). Simple tasks only benefit slightly from CoT prompting.\\nTypes of CoT prompts#\\nTwo main types of CoT prompting:\\n\\nFew-shot CoT.

Comparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept.

It is of two types\\nMemory for agents Memory for agents At Sequoia’s AI Ascent conference in March, I talked about three limitations for agents: planning, UX, and memory. But what even is memory? While the exact shape of memory that your agent has may differ by application, we do see different high level types of memory. Below is my rough, ELI5 explanation of each type and practical ways for how todays agents may use and update this memory type. Besides just thinking about the type of memory to update in their agents, we also see developers thinking about how to update agent memory. One way to update agent memory is “in the hot path”. Why do we care about memory for agents?\\nAgent Types 12 Table-driven agents use a percept sequence/action table in memory to ﬁnd the next action. They are implemented by a (large) lookup table.

In a professional setup like this, the agent is responsible for extracting tasks from conversations and passing them to an employee and once the employee completes the task the agent will convey the output to the user. Then use the solutions of those basic tasks as in-context examples to solve the current task.\\nConclusion & Next Steps\\nIn this blog, we saw that design choices for Memory depend on the end use case. This analogy is better captured in the following table:\\nDeep dive into various types of Agent Memory\\nChoosing the right Memory design in Production\\nSince agents are powered by LLMs, they are inherently probabilistic.\\nLLMs as Operating Systems: Agent Memory - DeepLearning.AI Build agents with long-term, persistent memory using Letta to manage and edit context efficiently.

It is of two types\\nMemory for agents Memory for agents At Sequoia’s AI Ascent conference in March, I talked about three limitations for agents: planning, UX, and memory. But what even is memory? While the exact shape of memory that your agent has may differ by application, we do see different high level types of memory. Below is my rough, ELI5 explanation of each type and practical ways for how todays agents may use and update this memory type. Besides just thinking about the type of memory to update in their agents, we also see developers thinking about how to update agent memory. One way to update agent memory is “in the hot path”. Why do we care about memory for agents?\\nAgent Types 12 Table-driven agents use a percept sequence/action table in memory to ﬁnd the next action. They are implemented by a (large) lookup table. Simple reﬂex agents are based on condition-action rules, implemented with an appropriate production system. They are stateless devices which do not have memory of past world states.

In a professional setup like this, the agent is responsible for extracting tasks from conversations and passing them to an employee and once the employee completes the task the agent will convey the output to the user. Then use the solutions of those basic tasks as in-context examples to solve the current task.\\nConclusion & Next Steps\\nIn this blog, we saw that design choices for Memory depend on the end use case. This analogy is better captured in the following table:\\nDeep dive into various types of Agent Memory\\nChoosing the right Memory design in Production\\nSince agents are powered by LLMs, they are inherently probabilistic.\\nLLMs as Operating Systems: Agent Memory - DeepLearning.AI Build agents with long-term, persistent memory using Letta to manage and edit context efficiently.
